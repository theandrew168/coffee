# coffee
Who buys the coffee today?

## Setup
If you are unfamiliar with [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), I suggest taking a brief moment to learn about them and set one up.
The Python docs provide a great [tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) for getting started with virtual environments and packages.

This project's dependencies can be installed via pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running
With the project setup, simply run `app.py`:
```
python3 app.py
```
